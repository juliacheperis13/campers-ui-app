# React Project (Built with Vite)

This is a React project bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)  
  Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juliacheperis13/campers-ui-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd campers-ui-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

### Building for Production
